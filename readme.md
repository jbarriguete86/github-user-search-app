## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I reinforced the usage of responsiveness, as well as, using the mobile first approach.

I'm really proud of used a modular javascript approach. I've been intentionally practicing this type of code writing

### Continued development

I would love to continue focusing on building better and more responsive website, maybe next time use the A11y to make my web app accessible.
